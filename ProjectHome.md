<p>SFBrowser is a file browser and uploader for jquery and php5. It returns a list of objects with containing the names and additional information of the selected files.<br />
You can use it, like any open-file-dialog, to select one or more files. Most inherent functionalities are also there like: file upload, file preview, creating folders and renaming or deleting files and folders.</p>

<br /><br /><br />

_**I will not be developing SFBrowser any further for the time being.**_

_**There have been a lot of new developments that I've been meaning to implement. To do this I'd rather rewrite the entire front- and backend source than implement it in the current one. Not that the current source is bad, I'm just a better programmer than I was five years ago. But for now, I simply do not have the time (maybe in the future).**_

_**So if you have fixes for issues I'd be happy to commit them, but I'm not going to fix them for you. Or if you really want to I could make you project member.**_

~~SFBrowser is also available as a [Wordpress plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sfbrowser/).~~
